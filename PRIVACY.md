Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

This Service does not use cookies. 

**Security**

Files stored and shared via Ouisync are encrypted end-to-end and are not stored by eQualitie. We value user privacy and security, and thus we strive to use all possible means of protecting user data. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
